# Commom issues

### DAG won't run on schedule
- The most common reason why a DAG won't run on schedule is the scheduler is not running.
- Airflow contains several components that accomplish various aspects of the system. The **Airflow Scheduler** handles DAG run and task scheduling. If it is not running, no new tasks can run.
- You will often see an error in the Web UI if the scheduler component is not running. This issue can be fixed by running the `airflow scheduler` from the command-line.
- Another common issue with scheduling is the scenario where atleast one schedule interval period has not passed since either the start date or the last DAG run.
